# DEERCHEER HUB - Project Status

## 🚀 Development Workflow Status

### Phase 1: Database Foundation ✅ COMPLETED (2025-09-02)

**Objective**: Implement complete database schema for streaming platform core features

**Workflow Files**:
- ✅ `docs/features/database-foundation/completed/brainstorm.md` - Initial feature ideation and scope
- ✅ `docs/features/database-foundation/completed/architecture-plan.md` - Technical implementation plan  
- ✅ Database Schema Applied - 8 core tables with RLS, triggers, and real-time features

**Agents Used**:
1. ✅ Product Manager Agent - Created user stories and acceptance criteria
2. ✅ System Architect Agent - Created comprehensive technical architecture
3. ✅ Backend Database Agent - Implemented complete PostgreSQL schema

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ Complete database schema (8 tables): profiles, movies, streaming_sessions, session_movies, votes, chat_messages, session_analytics, user_preferences
- ✅ Row Level Security policies for all tables
- ✅ Database functions and triggers for automation
- ✅ Real-time subscriptions configuration
- ✅ TypeScript types updated in `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts`
- ✅ Query functions created in `src/integrations/supabase/queries.ts`

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Database foundation is ready for frontend development

## 🎯 Next Development Phase

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration (Ready to Start)

**Objective**: Integrate React frontend with new database schema

**Recommended Approach**:
1. **Streaming Features Agent** - Update existing components to use new database schema
2. **shadcn/ui Builder Agent** - Enhance UI components for better user experience  
3. **Auth Security Agent** - Implement proper authentication flows with new profile system

**Priority Features**:
1. Update authentication to work with new profiles table
2. Implement movie roulette functionality 
3. Create real-time voting system
4. Build streaming dashboard with analytics
5. Implement chat system

**Next Steps**:
1. Create new brainstorm for frontend integration phase
2. Run Product Manager Agent to structure frontend user stories
3. Use System Architect Agent to plan frontend architecture
4. Execute specialized agents for implementation

## 🔄 Workflow Management Rules

### For Completed Phases:
- ✅ Move executed workflow files to `docs/features/{phase-name}/completed/`
- ✅ Update this PROJECT-STATUS.md with completion details
- ✅ Archive agent conversations and deliverables
- ✅ **Update CLAUDE.md** with phase completion changes (via System Architect Agent)

### For Active Development:
